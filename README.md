===========

This is the website for the Programming Language and Systems Group at UNSW.

This website is built using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll). 

From your Haskell platform equipped shell, type:

    cabal install hakyll

Then, assuming `cabal` has successfully installed Hakyll, type

    cd hakyll
    ghc --make site.hs
    ./site --help

You should see a variety of options, including how to run a preview server to view the site.
