<H2> Research </h2>
We are interested in a wide range of research topics concerning programming languages and associated software systems with a particular focus on the intersection of theory and practice. This, quite naturally, makes computational calculi and programming languages derived from these calculi an integral part of our work. Hence, much of our attention is focused on functional programming, which is the most successful programming paradigm founded on a rigorous mathematical discipline. It's foundation, the lambda calculus, has an elegant computational theory and is arguably the smallest universal programming language. As such, the lambda calculus is also crucial to understand the properties of language paradigms other functional programming. We apply insights derived from foundational studies to areas that span programming language design, compilers, parallel and high-performance computing, and computer security.

Within UNSW, we cooperate with the CORG group (programming language implementations, compiler optimisations and dynamic compilation). Moreover, we are involved in the ERTOS (Embedded, Real-Time and Operating Systems) program of NICTA. We collaborate with a number of international partners, including close work with the GHC team at Microsoft Research Cambridge.

  <h2> Projects </h2>

  <h3> <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell">Data Parallel Haskell </a></h3>

Data Parallel Haskell (DPH) is one of the core projects of our group 
and aims at providing full support for nested data parallelism
for Haskell targeting multicore CPUs. The current experimental 
implementation is  available as an extension to
the Glasgow Haskell Compiler as a set of cabal packages, 

<h3><a href="http://repa.ouroborus.net">Repa</a></h3>

Repa is a Haskell library which supports parallel multidimensional
matrix calculations and stencil operations. These operations are more
specialised than nested data parallelism, but play a central role in a
large range of numerical computations. Due to their more specific
nature, these computations can be optimised more aggressively. 

  <h3><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate"> Accelerate</a> </h3>

Accelerate is a domain-specific array language embedded in Haskell,
which generates code exploiting the parallel capabilities of graphical
processing units (GPU), for applications in areas including physical
simulations and computer vision.

  <h3> <a href="http://www.ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/filesystems.pml"> Trustworthy File Systems </a></h3> This project is a
  cooperation with researchers from the <a href"http://www.ssrg.nicta.com.au"> Software Systems Research Group</a> at 
  NICTA investigating the automated
  synthesis of file-system code (and matching correctness proofs) from
  formal specifications. More precisely, a file system is specified as
  an OS interface, an on-disk data structure, and a high-level
  behavioural description matching the two.

<!-- 
<p class="block"><strong>Please note:</strong> As with all designs I publish on <a href="http://oswd.org/userinfo.phtml?user=Andreas">my page at OSWD.org</a>, I have not aimed at making any kind of trendy or shiny design. I prefer to keep it clean and simple, and let others add the details that will make the design special and unique. However, the design has some useful built-in features, such as a print CSS and full functionality when degrading to no-CSS mode. You can use the design as it is, but I recommend that you play around with it. Add things, remove things, let your creativity flow!</p>
